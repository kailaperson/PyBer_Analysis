## Summary
Three business recommendations to address the disparties among the city types is the following: 
  - Rural : Hire more drivers, decrease the average fare per driver to inrease total fares.

  - Suburban : Hire more drivers, and slighty increase the average fare per ride to increase total fares.

  - Urban : Increase the average per driver to accomodate urban drivers to increase number of drivers.

# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data, then display the data in a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
The following image is the DataFrame that holds the ride-sharing statistics for each city type: 
  - Rural cities have the least total rides, drivers and fares, the most average fare per ride, and the most average fare per driver. 
  
  - Urban cities have the highest total rides, drivers and fares, the least average fare per ride and the least average fare per driver. 
  
  - Suburban cities have the middle amount of statistics.

## Summary
Three business recommendations to address the disparties among the city types is the following: 
  - Rural : Hire more drivers, decrease the average fare per driver to inrease total fares.

  - Suburban : Hire more drivers, and slighty increase the average fare per ride to increase total fares.

  - Urban : Increase the average per driver to accomodate urban drivers to increase number of drivers.
